    <h1>Privacy Policy for DeepTicker</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 5, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy describes how DeepTicker handles your information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>DeepTicker is designed to respect your privacy. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you. The application's core functionality relies on the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Data:</strong> We store the stock symbols, number of shares, and purchase prices that you enter into the application. This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information you provide is used solely to provide the features of the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To display your stock portfolio and track its performance.</li>
        <li>To fetch up-to-date stock prices and financial data.</li>
        <li>To generate AI-powered analysis and insights about your portfolio.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DeepTicker uses third-party services to provide its features. When you use the app, some of your data is shared with these services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alpha Vantage:</strong> To provide real-time and historical stock price data, the stock symbols in your portfolio are sent to the Alpha Vantage API. You can review their privacy policy at <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/privacy_policy">www.alphavantage.co/privacy_policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Services:</strong> To generate portfolio analysis and predictions, information about your holdings (such as stock symbols and current values) is sent to AI service providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Azure, depending on your selected provider). This data is used to provide you with insights. We do not send any personally identifiable information.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>DeepTicker offers optional in-app purchases to unlock premium features. All purchases are processed securely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Purchase records are maintained by Apple and subject to their privacy policies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DeepSeek Pro:</strong> A one-time purchase that unlocks access to multiple AI models, custom analysis prompts, and the ability to use your own API keys.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you make a purchase, Apple may collect transaction data according to their privacy policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All of your portfolio data is stored exclusively on your device using standard system storage. We do not have access to this data. Since the data is stored locally, its security is tied to the overall security of your device.</p>
    
    <h2>API Keys</h2>
    <p>If you use the premium version of DeepTicker and provide your own API keys for AI services, these keys are stored securely in your device's Keychain. We do not transmit, store, or have access to your API keys on our servers. The keys remain on your device and are used only to communicate directly with the third-party AI service providers you choose.</p>
    
    <h2>Financial Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> DeepTicker provides information and AI-generated insights for educational and informational purposes only. <strong>This is not financial advice.</strong> The AI-generated analysis should not be considered as recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any securities.</p>
    <p>You should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investing in securities involves risk, including possible loss of principal. DeepTicker and its developers are not registered investment advisors and do not provide personalized financial advice.</p>
    <p>The accuracy of data and AI-generated insights is not guaranteed. Market data may be delayed or inaccurate. Always verify information with official sources before making investment decisions.</p>
